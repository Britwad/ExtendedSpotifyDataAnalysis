# ExtendedSpotifyDataAnalysis
My second attempt at parsing/processing Spotify Data (In Java...)

To find data go to https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/ and tick boxes for Account data and Extended Streaming History. Wait about 1 month for data.

From Account Data: Put YourLibrary.json in the SpotifyData folder

From Extended Streaming History: Put all Streaming_History_Audio files in the SpotifyData folder
